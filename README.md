# Sequential-Forward-Selection-Algorithm
e a program to implement the sequential forward selection algorithm to identify important features. The program will take one input: a dataset where the last column is the class variable. The program will load the dataset, and then use wrapper approach with sequential forward selection strategy to find a set of important features. You can use any supervised learning method for measuring the performance (accuracy) in the wrapper approach. You will use stratified 5-fold cross validation for measuring accuracy. Your program will keep adding the features as long as there is some improvement in the classification accuracy. The output of the program will be the set of important features on the console
